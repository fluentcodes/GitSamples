# Topic Branch master
The sandbox repository should show how you can use git to
* gather codes from experiment
* divide it in topic branches
* share it with others
* document it with an external wiki

So you will find only this README on master. **The branches contains the code**.
Information about the code content is in the [github wiki](https://github.com/fluentcodes/sandbox/wiki).

It's intention is to be a kind of memory for experiments, when one need to get into a special topic. Sometimes
frameworks or languages don't work as one expect or a non working solution is published.

Hopefully one find a solution at the end. But the pitfalls, others can fall into too, are lost. One can see this with a lot of
answers on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

* learning from solutions that doesn't work
* add code in a structured manner
* solutions that hopefully immediately work
* free (wiki) documentation from code snippets

With this sandbox repository I just cleaned up some other sandboxes I had before with the concept of the topic map.
The external wiki is the wiki of github.

I filled it initially with some content, but not all.

This September I work on
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Java
* some css for [elasticobjects.org](http://elasticobjects.org)
