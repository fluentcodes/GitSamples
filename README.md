# Topic Branch: Master

The **GitSamples** repository contains a mix of Topic Branches which are not handled in other GitSample Topic Repositories

GitSamples
* gather codes from experiment in working tests
* handle different environments in **topic branches**
* document it directly in README.md within Topic Packages
* share it with others

You find only this README on this master **Topic Branch**. 

## Other GitSamples
* [GitSamples-Java](https://github.com/fluentcodes/GitSamples-Java): All around java with emphasis on [Java-8](https://github.com/fluentcodes/GitSamples-Java/tree/java-8) and [Design Pattern](https://github.com/fluentcodes/GitSamples-Java/tree/java-design-pattern)
* [GitSamples-GIT](https://github.com/fluentcodes/GitSamples-GIT): Git samples with test branches for own experiments.
* [GitSamples-Spring](https://github.com/fluentcodes/GitSamples-Spring): Spring Topic Branches
* [GitSamples-Java-Libs](https://github.com/fluentcodes/GitSamples-Java-Libs): Topic Branches for different Java Libs

## Intention
The intention of GitSamples is to be a kind of memory for experiments, when one need to get into a special topic. Sometimes
frameworks or languages don't work as one expect or a non working solution is published.

Hopefully one find a solution at the end. But the pitfalls, others can fall into too, are lost. One can see this with a lot of
answers on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

* learning from solutions that doesn't work
* add code in a structured manner
* solutions that hopefully immediately work
* free (wiki) documentation from code snippets

With this sandbox repository I just cleaned up some other sandboxes I had before with the concept of the topic map.
The external wiki is the wiki of github.

I filled it initially with some content, but not all.
